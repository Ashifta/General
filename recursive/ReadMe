Let me discuss the phylosophy of god in terrms of simple recusive function example.

Person should have knowlege on recusive function, concept of stack and stack unwinding.

If recusive function loops infinitly program will crash. We blame the designer/programmer, if it ends on its own environmental limits.
Its all depends upon the resource availablility and ultimatly according to the wills of the programmer.
 
Masha allah, Allah has provide an end date(Death) for us, so we never blame our creator/allah since we will surely ends, no testing is required. If a person born, he will die.
But in computer programming, we are not whether recusive function loops infinitly or not.

The person who interept my reading, I guess you have commonsence, intelligent and perspective of life, here starts your program

Once a particular time of our life, we have a light of knowlege that, there is a god, as soon as we know this, we will carefully observe our days to do good deeds and actions so that, we ourself enlighten to 
different levels. so I have call this as a function "liveToday", this will continute to call until specified time, which is not in our control 
but a specified condition should meet, conditon is generic and it may self descruct and conditon by other outside causes. However, that will be executed any day but it will be in "liveToday:

Duringt end of the life, stack unwinding takes place, where you can see, what you have prepared for the end result of every day.
You will be regret if you find count of bad deeds are more. 


If code and execute according to the creator/designers then we dont need a regret of feeling, instead we full filled the requirement of our designer.
and our algorithm has more reputationa and having good performance so that, it will be stared by the communnity and gets more revards and shares and fortuned.
